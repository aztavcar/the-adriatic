  <p><em>The Adriatic</em> is the publishing arm of the Institute for Strategic Solutions, a Ljubljana-based consultancy that has worked with businesses across the region since 2011. What began as Strategic Foresight - a bulletin tracking shifts in politics and markets - has grown into a publication for readers who want to understand the currents shaping the Western Balkans and the world beyond.</p>

  <p>We publish essays, reportage and analysis on politics, business and culture. New work appears online throughout the year; an annual print edition collects each year's essential reading into a single volume worth keeping.</p>

  <h2>Contribute</h2>

  <p>We publish essays, reportage, and criticism on politics, business, and culture. A piece on port logistics in Koper might sit alongside an essay on American decline or a profile of a Croatian architect. What connects the work is clarity and a perspective rooted in this region.</p>

  <p>We welcome submissions from journalists, academics, analysts, and writers who have something to say. We're interested in work that wouldn't find a home elsewhere - too specific for global publications, too ambitious for local press.</p>

  <h3>Submissions</h3>

  <p>Send completed drafts of at least 500 words to info@isr.si. Include a brief note on who you are and why the piece belongs here. <mark class="yellow">We read everything.</mark></p>
