President Trump told a wary audience of world leaders and executives on Wednesday that he would not use military force to seize Greenland, retreating from weeks of ambiguity - but in the same breath warned America's closest allies that their resistance would not be forgotten.

"You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative," Mr Trump said in a rambling address at the World Economic Forum. "Or you can say no, and we will remember."

The speech, delivered to a Congress Hall packed with billionaires jostling for seats, capped two days of escalating transatlantic tension that have transformed this Alpine gathering into something closer to a diplomatic crisis summit. Within hours of Mr Trump leaving the stage, the [<mark class="yellow">European Parliament froze ratification</mark>](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/european-lawmakers-suspend-us-trade-deal-amid-greenland-tariff-tensions.html) of the trade agreement it had struck with Washington last summer, citing his tariff threats as an attack on European sovereignty.

The president arrived in Switzerland after Air Force One turned back mid-flight on Tuesday owing to an electrical fault, delaying his appearance by several hours. But the wait did little to soften his message. He derided European nations as unrecognizable and "not heading in the right direction," criticised NATO as an unreliable alliance, and took aim at Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, who a day earlier had declared the American-led world order effectively dead.

"Canada lives because of the United States," Mr Trump said. "Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements."

The president also repeatedly referred to "Iceland" when he appeared to mean Greenland - a slip the White House later attributed to his written remarks describing the territory as "a piece of ice."

## A coordinated European response

Mr Trump's appearance followed a striking display of unity from European leaders, who used Tuesday's sessions to mount what amounted to a co-ordinated rebuttal before the president even landed.

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, warned of a [<mark class="green">"profound global shift"</mark>](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/heads-of-state-gathering-davos-2026-what-they-saying/) towards autocracy and urged Europe not to bend to "the law of the strongest." Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, declared that Greenland's sovereignty was "nonnegotiable" and announced a major investment package for the Arctic territory. Mr Carney argued that middle powers must band together or risk finding themselves [<mark>"on the menu."</mark>](https://www.euronews.com/2026/01/21/davos-2026-who-said-what-so-far-at-worlds-top-political-and-business-summit)

The sharpest language came from Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who accused world leaders of "rolling over" for the president. "I should have brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders," Mr Newsom told reporters. He called Mr Trump a "T-Rex" and said traditional diplomacy would not work. Mr Trump spotted him in the audience during Wednesday's address and called him "a good guy."

## Trade deal suspended

The European Parliament's trade committee voted on Wednesday afternoon to suspend work on the EU-US agreement indefinitely. Bernd Lange, the committee's chairman, said the bloc would not proceed "until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation."

Lawmakers said they would discuss invoking the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument — a powerful set of retaliatory measures sometimes called the bloc's [<mark class="rose">"trade bazooka"</mark>](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/european-lawmakers-suspend-us-trade-deal-amid-greenland-tariff-tensions.html) — which could restrict American companies' access to European markets and block them from public tenders.

The trade pact, agreed at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort last July, had been due for a ratification vote next week. Its suspension leaves transatlantic commerce in limbo and deepens the rift between Washington and Brussels.

## What comes next

Mr Trump is expected to hold bilateral meetings with several foreign leaders before departing Davos on Wednesday evening. On Thursday, the White House plans to announce the charter for its "Board of Peace," a body originally conceived to oversee reconstruction in Gaza but which critics say may be designed to rival the United Nations. Around 25 countries have reportedly agreed to join; France has refused.

The president said he had invited Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's president, to participate.
