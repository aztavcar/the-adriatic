  Albania's ruling Socialist Party has secured a fourth consecutive term, extending Edi Rama's reign as the longest-serving leader of the country's post-communist era.

The Socialist Party (PS) remains the dominant force in Albania's politics. Winning 52% of the vote and securing 82 seats in the 140-seat parliament, premier Edi Rama now enters his fourth consecutive term as prime minister – the longest-serving democratic leader since the fall of communism in the early 1990s.

The margin of victory over the opposition Democratic Party (PD)-led alliance, which managed just 34% of the vote, was more decisive than many observers had anticipated. Internal divisions, corruption charges against the opposition leader, and an unsuccessful attempt to replicate American-style populist politics left the opposition looking both divided and dated.

## The European promise

The Socialist's campaign successfully framed the election as a choice between steady progress towards EU membership and a return to the instability of the past. After a decade as a candidate country, Albania began detailed accession talks with the bloc in late 2024. Rama has promised EU accession by 2030, an ambitious timeline that he insists only he can deliver on.

The prospect of EU integration remains a powerful motivator for many Albanian voters, even as the path forward is far from guaranteed.

## A fragmented opposition

The opposition has struggled to present itself as a credible alternative. The PD's leader remains hampered by significant legal troubles, barred from entry to both the United States and United Kingdom. His advanced age and legal woes may trigger renewed internal struggles over the party's leadership.

For now, Albania's voters have opted for continuity over uncertainty. Whether that decision will bring the hoped-for European future closer remains an open question.
