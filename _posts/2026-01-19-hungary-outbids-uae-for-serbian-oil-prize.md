MOL Group and Gazprom Neft reached provisional agreement on Monday over the sale of Russia's majority stake in Serbia's state oil company NIS, marking a significant step towards ending months of sanctions-driven uncertainty around the Balkans' most important energy asset.

Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Đedović Handanović announced that [the two companies had agreed on basic terms](https://biznis.kurir.rs/info-biz/9890001/prodat-nis) for transferring Gazprom's 56.15% shareholding. The deal still requires approval from the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control before completion by a 24 March deadline.

The agreement follows intense pressure from Washington. The Biden administration [imposed sanctions on NIS](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2626) in January 2025, citing Russian control; after several extensions, restrictions finally took effect last October. The company's Pančevo refinery (Serbia's only facility, with 4.8-million-tonne annual capacity) was forced to shut down in December after Croatia's Janaf pipeline halted oil deliveries. Streets remained calm only because MOL stepped in with emergency fuel supplies from Hungary.

Under the provisional deal, [Serbia will increase its own stake by 5%](https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/115687/), bringing state ownership above the symbolic 34% threshold. "We managed to improve our position compared to 2008, when we remained below 30% ownership," Đedović Handanović said at a Monday press conference, emphasising that the additional shares would give Belgrade greater voting rights to protect citizens' interests.

The UAE's state-owned ADNOC is also expected to participate, though exact shareholding splits remain under negotiation. Analysts including Erste Bank's Tamás Pletser [previously suggested](https://www.valaszonline.hu/2026/01/19/mol-nis-olaj-uzlet-szankcio-gazprom-adnoc-vezetek-finomito/) MOL might focus on retail operations whilst ADNOC takes the refinery itself, though Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó [stressed last week](https://hungarytoday.hu/agreement-near-as-mol-negotiates-stake-in-serbian-oil-company-nis/) that "MOL seeks majority ownership."

The Hungarian oil giant has strong strategic incentives. Szijjártó described the acquisition as transformative for Central European energy security, creating an integrated triangle of refineries across Bratislava, Százhalombatta (Hungary), and Pančevo. "Without Hungary there is no energy security in Serbia, and without Serbia there is no energy security in Hungary," he said during Thursday talks in Belgrade, announcing plans for new oil and petroleum product pipelines linking the two countries.

MOL has leveraged its existing regional presence throughout the crisis. During NIS's shutdown, the company tripled capacity at its three Serbian fuel depots and increased petrol station turnover by over 20%. That operational readiness, combined with geographic synergies and the Russians' weakened bargaining position, helped Budapest edge out Abu Dhabi as preferred buyer.

The economics remain uncertain. Erste's Pletser [estimated the Russian stake's value at €1.4 billion](https://index.hu/gazdasag/2026/01/18/energetika-energiaellatas-nis-nyersanyagpiac-nyersanyagellatas-koolaj-szerbia-mol/) last week, noting that "anything at or below this price would be viewed favourably" by MOL shareholders. Higher valuations could trigger short-term share price stagnation. Yet Gazprom faces its own deadline: if no US-approved sale completes by late March, sanctions snap back and the Russian stake becomes worthless. This severely limits Moscow's leverage in final price negotiations.

The provisional agreement represents months of diplomatic effort across three continents. President Aleksandar Vučić held talks with UAE leadership in Abu Dhabi mid-January whilst Szijjártó shuttled between Belgrade and Budapest coordinating governmental support. Orbán's administration has framed the deal as resistance against "Brussels diktat," positioning Hungary-Serbia energy cooperation as bulwark against EU policies that have "worsened Central Europe's situation by cutting off reliable sources."

[Pančevo refinery restarted operations on Sunday](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/russias-gazprom-neft-reaches-provisional-140202537.html) after Janaf resumed deliveries under temporary US licence arrangements. Đedović Handanović said refined diesel should reach Serbian pumps by 27 January, though full normalisation depends on OFAC's response to the proposed ownership restructure.

The office has until 23 January under current licensing to decide whether to extend operational permissions whilst reviewing the final sale agreement. If approved, the transaction would complete one of the largest forced divestments of Russian energy assets since the Ukraine invasion and cement Hungary's emergence as Central Europe's pivotal energy broker.
