You've found a placeholder. This article isn't real yet - we're still getting things ready behind the scenes.

What you're seeing here is how our typography looks in action. The headline above, the deck below it, the body text you're reading now. This is the rhythm of a finished piece, just without the substance.

## A section heading

Section headings break up longer articles into digestible parts. They're set slightly larger than the body text, with enough space above and below to give the eye a moment to rest.

### A smaller heading

For finer divisions within a section, we use this. Sparingly.

We'll have real reporting, essays, and analysis here soon. Stories from across the Adriatic and beyond - politics, business, culture, and the quieter currents that shape how people live.

## Highlighted links

We use highlighted links <a href="{{ '/newsletter' | relative_url }}" class="plain"><mark class="rose">like this</mark></a>. The effect is meant to look like someone ran a highlighter over the text - a subtle way to draw attention without shouting. It keeps attribution and emphasis feeling human rather than mechanical.

Four colours are available: <mark>blue</mark> for general emphasis, <mark class="yellow">yellow</mark> for neutral callouts, <mark class="green">green</mark> for positive notes, and <mark class="rose">rose</mark> for links and key points. Rose is our default for links - it pairs with the accent colour without being too loud.

Until then, thanks for poking around. If you'd like to know when we properly launch, sign up for <a href="{{ '/newsletter' | relative_url }}" class="plain"><mark class="rose">our newsletter</mark></a>.
