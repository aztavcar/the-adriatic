Varis Gilaj, a 20-something fitness influencer of Albanian descent, became the most talked-about man on English-language social media this week after a seven-second clip showed him towering over a Kick streamer at an Arizona State University (ASU) frat party - a moment the internet has declared the most consequential act of physical domination since David met Goliath.

Gilaj, who posts as <span class="social-handle">@v.varis</span> on TikTok and prominently displays the Albanian flag in his bio, was filmed on 5 February alongside Braden Peters, a divisive looksmaxxing streamer known online as Clavicular. Peters, who has built a following of 169,000 on the streaming platform Kick by rating strangers' facial structures with pseudo-scientific authority, found himself on the wrong end of his own metric. The clip, captioned by X user <span class="social-handle">@biggerboy111</span> as "Clavicular ran into a frat leader at ASU and got brutally frame mogged by him," collected 13.5 million views and 18,000 likes in three days.

## A sentence only the internet could love

The phrase requires a brief decoder ring. To be "frame mogged" is to be physically outclassed - to stand beside someone whose build makes yours look insufficient. "Looksmaxxing" is the manosphere's term for systematic self-improvement aimed at maximising one's physical attractiveness. "Clavicular" refers to the streamer's own fixation with bone structure. Stack these terms into a single caption, and the result reads less like English and more like the output of a subculture thesaurus left running overnight.

That absurdity is precisely what made it spread. Within 48 hours, the caption had been remixed into dozens of copypasta variations. One user posted a mock helpline number for victims of frame-mogging. Another wrote that they had cried only three times in the past decade - a breakup, the death of a grandparent, and the moment Clavicular was frame mogged. The joke was less about Gilaj or Peters and more about the sentence itself: a crystallisation of internet slang so dense that it collapsed under its own weight and became comedy.

By 11 February, attention had shifted to Gilaj himself. An X post describing him as Clavicular's "mysterious rival" earned 23,000 likes in a day. A clip circulated claiming that Androgenic, a fitness influencer ranked as the internet's number two "Chad," had flown to America specifically to find Gilaj and reclaim the title. The claim remains unverified. Merchandise appeared within the week.

## The Albanian flag in the frame

What makes the episode more than a curiosity is Gilaj's heritage, which he has never been shy about. His TikTok handle carries the Albanian flag emoji. He has posted content from Albania, captioned nostalgically about returning to "the motherland," and soundtracked videos with Albanian artists including Noizy. His comment section is peppered with Albanian-diaspora followers identifying themselves as fellow "Albos."

Gilaj fits a pattern. Over the past three years, Albanian identity has become a surprisingly potent brand on anglophone social media - visible, self-assured, and equipped with a sense of humour about its own intensity. The Albanian eagle hand gesture appears in comment sections with the regularity of a national salute. Diaspora creators from New York to London to Melbourne produce content that treats Albanian-ness as a kind of superpower, often with tongue planted firmly in cheek.

This is new. For most of the past two decades, Albania's image in Western media has been dominated by migration crises, organised crime stereotypes, and the occasional travel-blog discovery of the Riviera. The country's 2.4 million residents - and an estimated diaspora of roughly equal size - were largely invisible on platforms built for the English-speaking mainstream. TikTok changed that. By 2024, Albania had 1.53 million active TikTok users over the age of 18, a penetration rate that made the platform nearly inescapable. Albanian-language content flooded the algorithm, and diaspora creators served as a bridge to global audiences.

## A ban, a backlash, and a boomerang

The irony is that Albania's government has spent much of the past year trying to shut down the very platform responsible for this visibility. In March 2025, Prime Minister Edi Rama imposed a 12-month ban on TikTok, citing the fatal stabbing of a 14-year-old in Tirana after a dispute that originated on social media. The move drew criticism from journalists' associations, media freedom groups, and opposition parties, who noted that the ban arrived two months before parliamentary elections and that TikTok itself told the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) it had found no evidence either student involved had an account on its platform.

Six months in, the ban was widely flouted. Erion Veliaj, Tirana's jailed former mayor and a close Rama ally, continued posting from behind bars using a VPN. Albanian journalists, tourism promoters, and political activists carried on more or less as before. The Constitutional Court accepted a challenge to the ban's legality, though a ruling had not been issued as of early 2026.

The episode exposed a tension at the core of Albania's digital moment. The same platform that gave the country's diaspora an unprecedented megaphone also became a vector for moral panic and political opportunism. Rama's government banned TikTok to protect children; critics argued the real target was political speech in an election year. Both claims contain some truth, and the ban accomplished neither aim.

## Soft power by accident

Countries in the Western Balkans have long struggled to project a coherent image abroad. Tourism boards commission glossy campaigns; foreign ministries fund cultural diplomacy programmes; think-tanks produce strategy papers on nation-branding. The results tend to be forgettable.

What Albania has stumbled into is something different - an organic, bottom-up visibility driven by diaspora creators who are uncoordinated, unsanctioned, and often absurd. Nobody in Tirana's corridors of power planned for a muscular Albanian-American college student to become the protagonist of the internet's strangest compliment. But the clip did more for Albanian name-recognition in a single week than most state-funded campaigns achieve in a year.

The looksmaxxing subculture is, to put it mildly, not a vehicle for serious cultural exchange. Its fixation on bone structure and physical hierarchy sits somewhere between pseudoscience and performance art, and its overlaps with the manosphere warrant scepticism rather than celebration. But the meme economy does not run on substance. It runs on recognition. And when Gilaj's Albanian flag appeared in 13.5 million timelines, the country registered as something other than a synonym for difficulty.

Whether Albania can convert meme-grade attention into something more durable - tourism, trade, investment, even just a fairer hearing in Western media - is an open question. The infrastructure for that conversion barely exists. But the raw material is there, generated daily by a diaspora that treats its identity not as a burden to be managed but as a brand to be asserted.

Gilaj, for his part, has returned to posting gym videos. His follower count has surged past 150,000. The Albanian flag remains in his bio.
