  Serbia's capital faces mounting infrastructure challenges as ageing pipes and climate change strain the city's water supply.
---

For the third time this summer, residents of Belgrade's outer districts woke to find their taps running dry. What officials initially dismissed as routine maintenance has revealed a deeper crisis: decades of underinvestment have left the capital's water infrastructure dangerously fragile.

The numbers are stark. Nearly 40% of treated water never reaches consumers, lost to leaks in pipes that in some neighbourhoods date to the Austro-Hungarian era. Climate change has compounded the problem, with hotter summers increasing demand while droughts reduce supply.

## A political football

Water infrastructure has long been a political football in Serbian politics. Successive governments have announced ambitious modernisation plans, only to see them quietly shelved when attention shifts elsewhere. The current administration inherited a €2 billion backlog of needed repairs.

"Every mayor promises new pipes before elections," says one water utility engineer who asked not to be named. "After elections, the money goes somewhere else."

## Regional implications

Belgrade is not alone. Cities across the Western Balkans face similar challenges, the legacy of post-war neglect and the difficult transition from socialist-era infrastructure. EU accession requirements demand significant upgrades, but funding remains scarce.

For now, residents in affected areas have learned to stockpile water during the night, when pressure is higher. It's an adaptation that feels increasingly permanent.
