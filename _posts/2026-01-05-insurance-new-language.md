  In a world that increasingly trades complexity for convenience, Slovenia's insurance leaders make a stark case: maturity still matters.

The Slovenian insurance industry opened its flagship annual conference this week with an uncomfortable truth. Their sector is not and should not try to be fashionable. Nor, as one speaker put it, should it be designed for Instagram.

The head of the organising committee used his keynote address to confront a central dilemma. How can a profession rooted in complexity and long-term thinking communicate its message in a culture that increasingly rewards simplicity and spectacle. "If insurance becomes entertaining," he warned, "we are selling illusions."

## The infantilisation of discourse

He described a public discourse that has become binary and performative. One that prefers immediacy over substance and indulges a creeping cultural infantilism. "Insurance needs a new language," he argued. "Not to make it easier to swallow, but to make it understandable again."

The headline lecture painted a sobering picture of societal regression. Western societies are experiencing not merely a loss of maturity, but a collapse of adulthood as a cultural value. Leaders have become mirrors of their own narcissism. Institutions have surrendered to the logic of applause.

## The advertising question

The true agent of this shift, according to speakers, is not ideology but advertising. Advertising no longer appeals to reasoning adults but to consumers conditioned to behave like children. The goal is not to inform but to persuade without resistance.

In this environment, the ideal consumer is impulsive, suggestible and disengaged from consequence. Liberal democracy risks being displaced by what one speaker termed "infantocracy" – not tyranny, but a soft regime of reassurance where leaders do not govern but soothe.

The conference concluded with a consensus. Insurance cannot afford to surrender to the cultural winds that seek to simplify everything into comfort. Its role is not to flatter. It is to prepare.
