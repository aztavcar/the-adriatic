description: "Siniša Karan scraped through the presidential rerun by fewer than 11,000 votes - a margin that reveals as much about the erosion of Dodik's machine as its survival."
---

The partial rerun of the Republika Srpska presidential election on Sunday delivered the result Milorad Dodik needed but not the one he wanted. His candidate, Siniša Karan, held on with 224,384 votes to Branko Blanuša's 213,513, a margin of just under 11,000 in an entity of more than a million people. For a party that commands the bulk of state media, controls much of the public sector payroll and benefited from organised cross-border voter mobilisation from Serbia, the narrowness of the result amounts to a structural warning ahead of October's general election.

The rerun was itself a consequence of that weakness. When the original snap election was held on 23 November, Karan won by roughly 9,500 votes, but the Central Election Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina accepted opposition complaints of irregularities at 136 polling stations across 17 municipalities - including stations in Doboj and Zvornik where Karan had recorded results as high as 98 per cent - and annulled those tallies. Once the disputed votes were stripped out, Blanuša led by some 6,000, making Sunday's partial vote decisive. More than 4,000 observers monitored the rerun. The CEC has seven days to certify the final result.

The presidency Karan inherits is largely ceremonial and will last only until Bosnia's general election in October. But its political significance is considerable, because the contest was never really about Karan. It was about whether Dodik, who was stripped of the RS presidency in August 2025 after a court conviction for defying the High Representative and banned from public office for six years, could sustain his grip on the entity's institutions through a loyal substitute. The Ljubljana-based IFIMES institute, in a pre-election analysis, described the arrangement bluntly as a proxy presidency - a mechanism for preserving real power while formally complying with a judicial ban. Karan's own rhetoric did little to dispel that reading; he pledged on Sunday night to continue the political course of the past 23 years with ever greater vigour, language that positions him as a custodian of Dodik's separatist project rather than an independent actor.

Dodik himself appeared at the SNSD's election headquarters in Banja Luka to claim the result as his own, as he had done in November. He remains under both US and UK sanctions, continues to advocate the eventual separation of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in the days before the vote received a public endorsement from Moscow, whose foreign ministry praised the entity's leadership for resisting what it called Western pressure. The alignment is not new, but the timing - days before a vote whose legitimacy was already contested - was noted by Western diplomats tracking Russian influence operations in the Western Balkans. British intelligence assessments, referenced by the then foreign secretary David Lammy last year, have characterised the region as a potential next playground for the Kremlin, a formulation that officials in Sarajevo and Brussels regard as belated but broadly accurate.

For the opposition, the result is a defeat that nonetheless carries a usable lesson. Blanuša, a university professor and political newcomer who had the backing of most opposition parties, conceded on Sunday night but accused the SNSD of vote-buying and what he called election engineering - a characterisation consistent with the findings of domestic monitors and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation's detailed post-November assessment, which documented extreme statistical anomalies at specific stations and what it described as a decisive role for cross-border mobilisation. The opposition's calculation is that the introduction of scanners and biometric verification, expected to be in place by October, will reduce the scope for such practices and narrow the SNSD's structural advantage. Whether that confidence is justified will depend on the willingness of the CEC and international monitors to enforce the new standards in conditions that Dodik's apparatus will work to undermine.

The question that follows, one that extends well beyond the entity, is what happens when a judicially neutralised leader retains effective control of a governing party, a media environment and a security establishment. The Dayton architecture, now in its 31st year, was not designed for this contingency. The High Representative's office has the formal authority to intervene but has used it sparingly under Christian Schmidt, wary of provoking the very confrontation Dodik seeks. The European Union, which granted Bosnia candidate status in 2022, has tied further progress to rule-of-law reforms that the RS leadership has systematically obstructed. And Washington, absorbed by other priorities, has shown little appetite for the sustained diplomatic pressure that shifting the balance in Banja Luka would require.

October will be the real test. The general election will determine not only the RS presidency on a full-term basis but also the composition of entity and state-level parliaments, and it will do so in an environment where the SNSD's dominance is measurably declining. For Dodik, the strategic imperative is to lock in enough institutional control before that contest to survive a further narrowing of the margins. For the opposition, the task is to convert a near-miss into a credible governing alternative in less than eight months. And for the international community, the question remains the one it has been deferring for years: whether the post-Dayton order in Bosnia is robust enough to absorb a sustained challenge from within, or whether it requires the kind of active reinforcement that no outside actor currently seems willing to provide.
