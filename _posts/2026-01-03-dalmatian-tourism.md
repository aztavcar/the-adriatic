  Croatia's Adriatic coast faces an existential question: can mass tourism and authentic local life coexist?
---

Every summer, the ancient walls of Dubrovnik strain under the weight of cruise ship passengers. Split's Diocletian's Palace becomes a maze of selfie sticks. Hvar's harbour fills with superyachts while locals struggle to find affordable housing.

The numbers tell only part of the story. Croatia welcomed over 20 million tourists last year, most concentrated along a narrow coastal strip during a few summer months. The economic benefits are undeniable – tourism accounts for roughly a fifth of GDP. But the costs are becoming harder to ignore.

## The housing crisis

In Dubrovnik's old town, the permanent population has dwindled to a few hundred souls. Apartments that once housed families have been converted to short-term rentals. Young Croatians increasingly find themselves priced out of the very places their families have lived for generations.

"My grandmother's apartment is now on Airbnb," says one Split resident. "She couldn't afford not to rent it. But it means the neighbourhood has changed completely."

## Searching for balance

Some municipalities are experimenting with solutions. Visitor caps, higher tourist taxes, and restrictions on new accommodation have all been proposed or implemented. Venice's day-tripper fee has been watched closely as a potential model.

But the fundamental tension remains unresolved. The tourism industry employs tens of thousands and sustains communities that might otherwise see their young people emigrate. Curtailing it carries real economic risks.

The Adriatic coast finds itself at a crossroads. The path forward will require difficult choices about what kind of places these ancient cities want to become.
