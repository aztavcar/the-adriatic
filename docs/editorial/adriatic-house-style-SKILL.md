# The Adriatic — House Style

## Overview

The Adriatic is an English-language publication covering European politics, the Western Balkans, and transatlantic affairs for a cosmopolitan, policy-literate readership. The house style prioritises clarity, substance and analytical confidence over colour or opinion. It treats readers as intelligent adults who do not need hand-holding but do need context.

**Keywords**: news article, analysis, briefing, The Adriatic, house style, editorial, news writing

## Voice and register

- Neutral, analytical, slightly dry. The reporter's voice carries quiet authority without editorialising.
- Interpretive confidence is permitted — "the margins tell a different story," "a warning rather than a mandate" — but opinion-taking is not. The line is: state the political logic as logic, not as advocacy.
- Warm but not familiar. No first person. No rhetorical questions. No exclamation marks.
- Understated wit is welcome when it arises naturally; forced cleverness is not.

## Structure

- **Lede**: Carries the news in one or two sentences. Punchy and direct, not scene-setting.
- **Context block** (paragraphs 2–3): Immediate background the reader needs to understand the lede. Who, why, what preceded this.
- **Thematic sections**: After the opening, the piece opens out into sections organised by theme rather than strict descending importance. Each section develops a single strand of the story.
- **Section headers**: Use short, active headers (e.g. "The inner circle unravels," "What comes next"). These are navigational aids, not decoration. They should work as a scannable outline of the piece.
- **Kicker**: The final paragraph should land with purpose — either a forward-looking analytical point or a vivid detail that encapsulates the story's stakes. Never a bland summary.

## Quote integration

This is the publication's most distinctive editorial convention. The Adriatic paraphrases aggressively and quotes sparingly.

### Ratio
- Aim for approximately 90 per cent paraphrase, 10 per cent direct quotation across a full piece.
- A 1,200-word article should contain no more than three or four direct quotes. Often fewer.

### When to quote directly
- The source's exact words carry more rhetorical force than any paraphrase could (e.g. a resignation statement, a cutting political remark, a revealing admission).
- The wording itself is the news (e.g. a specific diplomatic formulation, a legal finding).
- A vivid or idiosyncratic phrase that would lose its character in paraphrase — especially useful for closing kickers.

### When to paraphrase
- Dry facts, dates, statistics, procedural information — always paraphrase.
- Statements that are politically significant but not rhetorically distinctive.
- Any quote that would require more than two sentences of block quotation. Break it up or paraphrase.
- Routine denials, confirmations and official responses.

### Technique
- **Partial quoting**: Embed a vivid fragment (two to five words) inside the reporter's own sentence. This is the primary quoting technique.
- **Patching**: When a source's remarks are spread across a press conference or interview, synthesise them into a paraphrased summary rather than stitching together multiple block quotes.
- **Attribution threading**: Vary placement — pre-quote ("Sarwar said the situation was untenable"), mid-sentence ("the appointment, McSweeney acknowledged, had been wrong"), post-quote. Use "said" as the default verb. Avoid "claimed," "admitted," "revealed" unless the connotation is intentional and earned.
- **No block quotes**: Never indent or set off a quote as a standalone block. All quotation is woven into the prose.

## Attribution and sourcing

- Named sources are always preferred. Institutional attribution ("according to a Friedrich Naumann Foundation analysis") is acceptable for think-tank material.
- Anonymous sourcing: use sparingly and only with role identification ("one Labour MP, speaking on condition of anonymity," "a senior Western diplomat"). Never "sources say" without qualification.
- **Sourcing disclosure**: Every synthesis piece ends with an italicised line listing the outlets and organisations whose reporting was drawn on. Format: *This article draws on reporting by [outlets] and on analyses published by [institutions].*

## Conventions

### Spelling and punctuation
- UK spelling throughout: -ise, -our, defence, licence (noun) / license (verb).
- Oxford comma: yes.
- Serial titles: Prime Minister, President, Foreign Secretary capitalised when used as a title before a name; lower case when used generically ("the prime minister said").
- Quotation marks: double quotes for direct speech. Single quotes for quotes-within-quotes and for scare quotes or ironic usage.

### Dates and numbers
- European date format: 9 February 2026. Never February 9, 2026.
- "Per cent" as two words, not % in running text.
- Spell out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above. Exceptions: ages, percentages, vote tallies and financial figures always use numerals.
- Currency: spell out on first use (e.g. "500 billion euros"), then symbol thereafter (€500bn).

### Formatting
- Dateline in caps at the top of the piece: BANJA LUKA, LONDON, BRUSSELS.
- Section headers in sentence case, bold or ## in Markdown.
- No bullet points or numbered lists in the body of an article. Ever.
- Em dashes with spaces: " — " not "—".
- Italics for publication names, foreign phrases on first use, and the sourcing disclosure line.

### Naming conventions
- Full name and role on first reference: "Siniša Karan, the SNSD candidate." Surname only thereafter.
- Acronyms: spell out on first use with the acronym in parentheses. Thereafter use the acronym.
- For Balkan and Central European names, use the correct diacritics: Blanuša, not Blanusa; Dodik needs none.

## Tone calibration by story type

| Story type | Interpretive latitude | Quote density | Length |
|---|---|---|---|
| Breaking news | Low — stick to confirmed facts | 1–2 quotes | 600–800 words |
| Day-of news analysis | Moderate — state political logic | 2–4 quotes | 1,000–1,400 words |
| Explainer / backgrounder | High — synthesise and contextualise | 1–2 quotes, mostly institutional attribution | 1,200–1,800 words |
| Regional briefing | Moderate to high | Minimal — mostly paraphrase | 800–1,200 words |

## What this style is not

- It is not wire copy. Wire copy is shorter, less interpretive, more quote-heavy and structurally rigid. The Adriatic allows more analytical breathing room.
- It is not opinion journalism. The reporter does not advocate. Analytical confidence is not the same as taking sides.
- It is not feature writing. No scene-setting ledes, no extended anecdotes, no first-person framing.
- It is not the Wintour diplomatic register (see separate skill). That style runs without subheadings, uses longer clause-heavy sentences, and gestures more freely at insider sourcing. The house style is more structured, more transparent about its sources, and slightly more restrained in its interpretive claims.
