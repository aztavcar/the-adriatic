# The Adriatic — Wintour Diplomatic Register

## Overview

This is an alternative voice for The Adriatic, reserved for stories where a more authoritative, continuous-prose, geopolitically framed register is appropriate. It is modelled on the approach of senior diplomatic editors at publications like the Guardian — particularly the tradition of Patrick Wintour's foreign affairs coverage: analytically assertive, structurally confident, sparing with direct quotation, and willing to situate any local development within a wider strategic frame.

**Keywords**: diplomatic, foreign policy, geopolitics, Wintour, continuous prose, analytical, The Adriatic

## When to use this register

- Stories involving interstate relations, multilateral institutions (EU, NATO, the UN, the OHR), or strategic-level developments.
- Pieces where the systemic framing — what a local event means for a broader order — matters more than the granular local detail.
- When explicitly requested by the editor or writer.
- Not for routine domestic politics, breaking news, or stories where the factual sequence is still unfolding and interpretive confidence would be premature.

## How it differs from the house style

| Element | House style | Wintour register |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Thematic sections with subheadings | Continuous prose, no subheadings |
| Paragraph length | Moderate, one idea per paragraph | Longer, clause-heavy, multiple facts per paragraph |
| Analytical confidence | Moderate — "the margin may matter more" | High — "the machinery of control is visibly failing" |
| Lede | Punchy, one or two sentences | Slightly longer, folds in stakes or strategic context |
| Sourcing tone | Transparent, attributes explicitly | Implies proximity — "officials believe," "the calculation is" |
| Quote density | ~10 per cent | Lower still — ~5 per cent or less |
| Geopolitical zoom-out | Present but contained in final section | Pervasive — every local event is a window onto the systemic |
| Kicker | A vivid detail or forward-looking point | A structural question left open for the reader |

## Voice

### Analytical assertiveness
- State political logic as established fact when the evidence supports it: "The move is designed to..." not "The move appears to be designed to..."
- Use constructions that convey analytical authority: "the calculation in [capital] is that," "the strategic imperative is," "the question remains the one it has been deferring for years."
- This assertiveness must be earned. It is not opinion. It is the reporter demonstrating mastery of the mechanics of the situation — who wants what, why, and what the second-order consequences are.

### Insider atmosphere
- Use formulations that imply access to decision-making circles: "senior Western diplomats believe," "officials in Sarajevo regard as," "the assessment in [ministry] is."
- **Critical caveat for The Adriatic**: When the reporting base is open-source synthesis rather than direct access, anchor these constructions to named public sources wherever possible. Attribute to think tanks, published analyses, or on-record statements. Do not fabricate proximity. The register should feel authoritative without being dishonest about the sourcing.
- Acceptable: "Western diplomats tracking Russian influence in the region have noted the timing" (when documented in published assessments or official statements).
- Not acceptable: "A senior EU official told The Adriatic" (when no such conversation occurred).

### Sentence architecture
- Longer, clause-heavy sentences connected by commas and subordinate clauses. Pack multiple pieces of information into a single flowing construction.
- Trust the reader to follow a complex sentence. Where a wire reporter would break a point into three short sentences, this register trusts one longer construction to carry the argument.
- Vary rhythm. A long, dense sentence followed by a short, declarative one creates emphasis. Use the short sentence for the analytical punchline.
- Example: "Dodik himself appeared at the SNSD's election headquarters in Banja Luka to claim the result as his own, as he had done in November. He remains under both US and UK sanctions."

## Structure

### No subheadings
- The piece runs as continuous prose throughout. The architecture is carried by the logic of the argument, not by formatting.
- Paragraph breaks serve as the only structural punctuation. Each paragraph should advance the argument by one step.

### Narrative arc
1. **Lede** (1 paragraph): The news, with a clause that signals the analytical frame. Not just what happened, but what it means.
2. **Mechanism** (2–3 paragraphs): How it happened — the procedural and political chain of events. This is where the factual spine of the piece lives.
3. **The actor** (1–2 paragraphs): The central figure or force — their strategy, their constraints, their recent moves. Situate them in a pattern of behaviour, not just in the immediate event.
4. **The opposition / counterforce** (1–2 paragraphs): Who pushed back, how, and with what effect. This is where the opposition's concession remarks, monitor findings or think-tank assessments appear.
5. **Zoom-out** (1–2 paragraphs): The systemic frame. What does this event mean for the wider order — Dayton, EU enlargement, Russian influence, transatlantic credibility? This is the signature move of the register.
6. **Closing question** (1 paragraph): End on an open structural question rather than a neat resolution. The reader should leave the piece thinking about a tension that remains unresolved.

## Quote integration

Even more paraphrase-dominant than the house style. Direct quotation is rare and surgical.

### Technique
- The primary quoting method is the **embedded fragment**: two to five words of a source's language woven into the reporter's own sentence. Full-sentence quotes are exceptional.
- When a full quote is used, it should reveal a position, a tone, or an intent that paraphrase cannot capture. It should feel like the single moment in the piece where you let the source speak because their exact words are irreplaceable.
- Attribution is often folded into the sentence structure rather than set apart: "language that positions him as a custodian of Dodik's separatist project rather than an independent actor" (no quote marks, no attribution verb — the analysis carries the weight).

### What not to do
- No duelling quotes. Do not construct a he-said-she-said passage with alternating block quotes from opposing sides.
- No decorative quoting. If a quote adds colour but not information, paraphrase it or drop it.
- No "speaking to reporters" or "in an interview with" constructions. These break the register's atmosphere of seamless authority.

## Sourcing and attribution

- The same sourcing disclosure line used in the house style appears at the end: *This article draws on reporting by [outlets] and on analyses published by [institutions].*
- Within the piece, attribute think-tank and institutional analyses by name and, where possible, by programme (e.g. "the Friedrich Naumann Foundation's Western Balkans programme," "the Ljubljana-based IFIMES institute").
- For diplomatic or official sourcing that is implied rather than direct, always ensure there is a documentable public basis. Never imply access that does not exist.

## Conventions

All spelling, punctuation, date, number and naming conventions follow the house style (see adriatic-house-style SKILL.md). The only differences are structural and tonal, not mechanical.

## Risks and limitations

This register works best when the writer has genuine command of the subject and the sourcing is strong enough to support the analytical confidence. When applied to a story the writer knows only superficially, or when the available sources are thin, the result can feel hollow or presumptuous. In those cases, default to the house style, which is more honest about the limits of its knowledge.

The Wintour register is a tool, not a default. Use it when the story earns it.
